# Authentication

Authentication with the AWS-related modules is handled by either specifying your access and secret key as ENV variables or module arguments.

For environment variables:

```bash
sudo pip install --upgrade pip
sudo pip install boto3
sudo yum install ansible
```


```bash
export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID='AK123'
export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY='abc123'
```
